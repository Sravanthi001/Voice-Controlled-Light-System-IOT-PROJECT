  <h3>How can you protect this light from being accessed or controlled by non- authorized users?</h3>
  <p>We will set the authorized users list (for example the family members in the house). When a user sends password to get access, the algorithm first checks if the user is one of the authorized user or not. If he is a member of the list, just by sending password he gets the access. If he is not the one in the list, admin receives a message with the details of user who sent the password, if the admin replies OK, the user gets access. If the admin doesn’t reply the access for the unauthorized user is denied.</p>
