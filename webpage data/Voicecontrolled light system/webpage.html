  <h2>PROJECT DETAILS:  VOICE CONTROLED LIGHT SYSTEM</h2>
  <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zxhH-pJPtM"> Project DEMO</a>
  <h2>Controlling lights with voice recognition:</h2>
  <p>In order to control the lights by our voice, we first need to enable the voice recognition sensor in 1shield Application in our mobile. Then tap on the speaker and by speaking which ever colour light we want or its specific name then that particular light gets on. In this project, there are 5 lights:  red, blue, green, yellow and cream. There is also one more option “dance” so when this command is used, the light on and off in specific time interval until next command is given.</p>
  
  <p>The list of commands and their operations:</p>
